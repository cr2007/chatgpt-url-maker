# ChatGPT Prompt URL Generator

A small web app built in [Vite](https://vite.dev) that builds shareable [ChatGPT](https://chat.com) URLs with prefilled prompts and optional ChatGPT feature hints.

You can try out the app now at https://cr2007.github.io/chatgpt-url-maker

Why this helps
- Create, copy, and open URLs that prefill prompts in ChatGPT for sharing or quick reuse.
- Adds optional flags (features, temporary chat) to the URL so workflows can be shared precisely.
